How to use:
1. Download above executable file
2. Make sure that the .exe file is in the same folder as your desired .txt file
3. Run the program, make sure to correctly input the name of the desired .txt file
4. Once the program is done, check the folder where the executable is located for four images, named <filename>-unsorted.png, <filename>-insertion-sort.png, <filename>-selection-sort.png, and <filename>-darkened.png
5. Enjoy your new abstract art! Image will most likely be very small, so make sure to zoom in. The bigger text file you give it, the better!
